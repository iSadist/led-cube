# LED-Cube

Code for controlling an LED Cube built with Arduino Uno.

## Construction
The cube consists of 64 lamps making up a 4x4x4 structure. Each column has its anode connected together and each layer shares their cathodes.
With this construction, each lamp can be turned on individually by applying power to a column and selecting a cathode layer to ground.
